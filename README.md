# Chess Trainer 

You start off on level 0 representing pure random play. Winning a game moves you up 2 levels, losing a game moves you down 1 level, a draw moves you up 1 level. By the time you get to level 100, you're superhuman at chess. The agent playing against you is generated prior to each chess game, persists for the duration of the game, then disappears forever. In other words, whatever strategies you encounter as you play, you'll never see those strategies again. Some agents randomly like bishops better than rooks, or randomly prefer the left side of the board vs the right, or really like moving one particular piece a lot. These aspects of the strategy change, but as you get closer to level 100, getting to ever-increasing levels of play, you'll start to notice patterns in the noise, strategies that are successful. For instance, by the time you get to around level, 40 the engine consistently understands that it's a good idea to protect and re-capture pieces (sometimes it won't because it thinks it sees something more important, but in general). By the time you get to level 70 (way above my level) it's playing recognizable openings to a deep level, not because it's memorized those openings but because it's good enough to undersand. The engine will teach you what's important for you to understand at your skill level... it'll teach you this often through humiliating defeat at times when you stuck to your guns and played what you thought you knew was right, and suddenly you're in checkmate. 

I have been playing chess for years, and this has engine has taught me the following valuable lessons, most of which I was not getting elsewhere:
1. Respect for the game. The AI seeming to play terribly is not an invitation for you to play terribly. It'll teach you this.
1. I don't value king safety enough. I can be blind to pressure building up on my king.
1. I often don't go after the opponent's king aggressively enough when an opportunity opens up.
1. I value material too much.
1. Tactics.
1. End game strategy.
1. Balance and pacing (when sometimes a slow pace is a good idea), especially in complex situations.
1. Chess is a much more open-ended and freely-flowing game than I thought. Playing against standard engines, you'll quickly get stuck playing a strategy you're not good enough to play. This engine has taught me to be comfortable saying "ehh... I'm just gonna do some bat sh*t crazy thing and go off the rails here"... but to actually understand when's a good time, for me personally, to do something like.
1. Most importantly, the engine shows you what you don't know about chess. It is the most excellent teacher I've seen at finding your misconceptions and presenting them to you on a silver platter. Think you should win because you castled and your opponent did not? Well, sure, if you're good enough to take advantage of something like that. This engine will precisely answer for you what strategies you're good enough to take advantage of.
